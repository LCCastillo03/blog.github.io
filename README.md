# Velaris Blog

Welcome to the Velaris Blog! This repository serves as a blog for exploring key asynchronous JavaScript concepts. The blog includes articles and examples on JavaScript Async, Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await, and the Event Loop. The repository is organized as follows:

- **`img/`**: Contains images related to the blog content.
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file where the blog content is displayed.
- **`styles.css`**: The stylesheet used for styling the blog.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Blog Topics

### 1. JavaScript Async

This section covers the basics of asynchronous JavaScript, including how it allows your code to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking execution. 

### 2. Callback

Learn about callbacks, which are functions passed as arguments to other functions and executed after the main function completes. This section discusses their use in handling asynchronous operations.

### 3. Promise

Explore Promises, which represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. This section explains how Promises enable writing asynchronous code that appears synchronous.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Creating a Promise**: Using the `Promise` constructor and the executor function.
- **Promise States**: Understanding Pending, Fulfilled, and Rejected states.
- **Handling Results**: Using the `.then()` method to handle promise outcomes.

### 4. Async/Await

This section introduces async/await, a feature that simplifies asynchronous code by making it look like synchronous code. Learn how to define async functions and use `await` to pause execution until promises are resolved.

### 5. Event Loop

Understand the Event Loop, which allows JavaScript to perform tasks asynchronously and manage multiple operations while keeping the program responsive.

## Getting Started

To read the blog:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The blog content will be styled using `styles.css`.

Explore the articles to deepen your understanding of asynchronous JavaScript and enhance your coding skills.
